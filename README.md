# Bayesian methods in machine learning: a brief introduction

### Abstract

Bayes' theorem, and in general Bayesian learning, offers a principled framework to update one's beliefs about an unknown quantity. At the heart of any machine learning (ML) problem is the identification of models that explain a given dataset well, where learning about its parameters, treated as random variables, is integral.

Bayesian methods therefore play an important role in many aspects of machine learning; this introductory talk aims to highlight some of the most prominent areas in Bayesian machine learning from the perspective of statisticians and analysts, drawing parallels between these areas and common problems that Bayesian statisticians work on.

### Intended audience and assumed background

Listeners with familiarity with Bayes' theorem, Bayesian statistics, and probability will be able to follow the materials covered. No background on advanced statistics or machine learning is assumed.

### Overview

This talk focuses two ML frameworks: Bayesian modeling and Bayesian decision-making. Each of these two topics is discussed sequentially, building from toy examples to cutting-edge ML technologies.

First, Bayesian modeling
